Linking code is preferable because of a programming concept called Separation of Concerns (SoC). Instead of having messy code that is all in the same file, web developers separate their code into different files, making each “concern” easier to understand and more convenient when changes must be made.
<script src="./exampleScript.js"></script> : towards the end of the Body tag

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a group of servers spread out over many locations. These servers store duplicate copies of data so that servers can fulfill data requests based on which servers are closest to the respective end-users. CDNs make for fast service less affected by high traffic.

The HTML parser does NOT process the next element in the HTML file until it loads and executes the <script> element, thus leading to a delay in load time and resulting in a poor user experience.
Additionally, scripts are loaded sequentially, so if one script depends on another script, they should be placed in that very order inside the HTML file.

DEFER
When a script contains functionality that requires interaction with the DOM, the defer attribute is the way to go.
<script src="example.js" defer></script>

ASYNC
The async attribute loads and executes the script asynchronously with the rest of the webpage.the HTML parser will continue parsing the rest of the HTML as the script is downloaded in the background. However, with the async attribute, the script will not wait until the entire page is parsed: it will execute immediately after it has been downloaded
<script src="example.js" async></script>
async is useful for scripts that are independent of other scripts in order to function accordingly. Thus, if it does not matter exactly at which point the script file is executed, asynchronous loading is the most suitable option as it optimizes web page load time.

DOM
The Document Object Model, abbreviated DOM, is a powerful tree-like structure that allows programmers to conceptualize hierarchy and access the elements on a web page.
In the DOM tree, the top-most node is called the root node, and it represents the HTML document. The descendants of the root node are the HTML tags in the document, starting with the <html> tag followed by the <head> and <body> tags and so on.
A parent node is the closest connected node to another node in the direction towards the root.
The DOM is an interface between scripting languages and a web page’s structure. 

Much like an element in an HTML page, the DOM allows us to access a node’s attributes, such as its class, id, and inline style.
DOM Nodes of type Element provide access to attributes of those elements declared in HTML markup. For instance, if an HTML tag has attributes like id or class or src, those attributes can be accessed through the DOM.

The document object in JavaScript is the door to the DOM structure. The document allows you to access the root node of the DOM tree.

document.body.innerHTML = 'The cat loves the dog.';
document.body.innerHTML = '<h2>This is a heading</h2>'; 

The .querySelector() method allows us to specify a CSS selector and then returns the first element that matches that selector. The following code would return the first paragraph in the document.
document.querySelector('p');

document.getElementById('bio').innerHTML = 'The description';

let blueElement = document.querySelector('.blue'); 
blueElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
document.querySelector('.blue').style.fontFamily = 'Roboto';
** Unlike CSS, the DOM style property does not implement a hyphen such as background-color, but rather camel case notation backgroundColor

CREATING AND INSERTING elements
In order to create an element and add it to the web page, you must assign it to be the child of an element that already exists on the DOM. We call this process appending. The .appendChild() method will add a child element as the last child node.

let paragraph = document.createElement('p');
paragraph.id = 'info'; 
paragraph.innerHTML = 'The text inside the paragraph';
document.body.appendChild(paragraph);
document.body.removeChild(paragraph);
document.getElementById('sign').hidden = true;

ONCLICK EVENT
You can add interactivity to DOM elements by assigning a function to run based on an event.

let element = document.getElementById('interact');
element.onclick = function() { element.style.backgroundColor = 'blue' };


TRAVERSING
Each DOM element node has a .parentNode and .children property. The property will return a list of the element’s children and return null if the element has no children.
The .firstChild property will grant access to the first child of that parent element.

const first = document.body.firstChild;
first.innerHTML = 'I am the child!';
first.parentNode.innerHTML = 'I am the parent and my inner HTML has been replaced!';
