= is used for assigning values to a variable in JavaScript.
== is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable.
=== is used for comparision between two variables but this will check strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two values.

 100==100 means both are int values and the other condition, 100 == "100" means int comparison with "100" string type of variable still returns true. It means == is not doing a strict type check.

  It returns true for 100 === 100 and it returns false for 100 === "100". It means === does a strict check for comparison. It checks datatype also and does a comparison based on it.
