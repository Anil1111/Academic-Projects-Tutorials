//We separate each key-value pair in an object literal with a comma (,). Keys are strings, but when we have a key that does not have any special characters in it, JavaScript allows us to omit the quotation marks:

// Objects store collections of key-value pairs.
// Each key-value pair is a propertyâ€”when a property is a function it is known as a method.
// An object literal is composed of comma-separated key-value pairs surrounded by curly braces.
// You can access, add or edit a property within an object by using dot notation or bracket notation.
//JavaScript objects are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed, even when they are declared as const. It is the reference to the object, bound to the variable, that cannot be changed.

//because When we passed spaceship into that function, obj became a reference to the memory location of the spaceship object, but not to the spaceship variable. This is because the obj parameter of the tryReassignment() function is a variable in its own right. The body of tryReassignment() has no knowledge of the spaceship variable at all!
//When we did the reassignment in the body of tryReassignment(), the obj variable came to refer to the memory location of the object {'identified' : false, 'transport type' : 'flying'}, while the spaceship variable was completely unchanged from its earlier value.
