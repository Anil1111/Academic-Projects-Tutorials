# Static vs Dynamic Websites

## Static Websites

- Consists of sites with `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`
- It is not completely static as it may contain interactions based on user events
- `Static` means that the code is not generated at the server but the raw source code is hosted on the server and is pre built
- It is pre-built during development
- Higher reactivity involves data being required to be fetched from the server and rerendering on the browser
- Security controls are easier
- Static hosts are cheaper and setup is easier Eg: Gatsby

## Dynamic Websites

- The HTML site is generated on runtime from the server itself by dynamically generating it
- Every response yields a new HTML page
- Rendering happens on the server and therefore there is a initial delay
- Security controls are easier
- Dynamic hosts are costlier and setup is complex Eg: AWS, Heroku
